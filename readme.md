#Motion Tracking Feature Wall

This repo contains the software for a prototype version of a Motion Tracking Feature Wall. The prototype version only tracks a green ball using a python program which communicates the position, speed, and angle of movement to the LED controller.

The two separate versions of the LED controller are included in ``arduino_led_controller`` and ``backup-board``. Ball tracking software is in ``python_ball_tracker``. More information on each of the modules is included below.
